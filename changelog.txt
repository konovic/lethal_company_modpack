v1.0.0
Initial github release

---

v0.4.1
+HotbarTweaks

Config:
Added pregenerated configs for all included mods (normally only generated on first launch)

HotbarTeaks
Default values perform exactly like the vanilla game
Change InvertDirection to `true` to reverse the scroll wheel direction for the hotbar
Note: Re-emphasizing that lower values for ScrollSpeed increase the scrolling speed e.g. 0.2 is faster than 0.3 (default value)

Mimics
	Difficulty Level 4 -> 5
Added a note about what the difficulty level actually represents
I'm banking on nobody actually reading this, if you do don't spoil it for anyone else and act like you never saw it yourself :)

Notes: Minor update to README

v0.4.0
-AdditionalSuits
+MoreSuits
+MoreEmotes
+LetMeLookDown
+Mimics

Version Bumps:
MoreCompany	-> 1.7.0
HelmetCamera	-> 2.1.3
LC_API? (Not sure if v0.3 used 2.1.0 or 2.1.1)

Config:
Changed default values for HelmetCamera
	monitorResolution  0 ->  3
	renderDistance	  20 -> 50
Looks better than default and should have minimal performance impact

Notes:
Added minor revision placeholder for when I have to remove a mod :^)
Added this file (modpack_changelog.txt)
Added modpack_versions.txt	-Versions for individual mods to track what needs updating
Added MODPACK_README.txt	-Installation and updating instructions
