v2.6.0
Remove r2modman support, see note in README
Basically boils down to stability issues and minor mod installation issues

Back to old markdown table for mods, now using each mod's manifest.json website_url for links
This is mostly to allow for automating the readme while still giving attribution to each mod author.
I may move to a solution in the future that goes back to linking each thunderstore.io page,
but I'd like to have as little manual intervention as possible.

Added mods:
+DraculaFlowBug
+FastSwitchPlayerViewInRadar
+JetpackWarning
+LethalAutocomplete
+MoreItems
+SkipToMultiplayerMenu

Removed mods:
-Memetastic (way too big, also got annoying fast)
-Terminal_History (functionality included in LethalAutocomplete)
-Yippee (bug sounds, scrap mod is still installed)

Nutcracker because it would be funny
---

Changed time between voices to 4x original setting

---
v0.4.1
+HotbarTweaks

Config:
Added pregenerated configs for all included mods (normally only generated on first launch)

HotbarTeaks
Default values perform exactly like the vanilla game
Change InvertDirection to `true` to reverse the scroll wheel direction for the hotbar
Note: Re-emphasizing that lower values for ScrollSpeed increase the scrolling speed e.g. 0.2 is faster than 0.3 (default value)

Mimics
	Difficulty Level 4 -> 5
Added a note about what the difficulty level actually represents
I'm banking on nobody actually reading this, if you do don't spoil it for anyone else and act like you never saw it yourself :)

Notes: Minor update to README
---
v0.4.0
-AdditionalSuits
+MoreSuits
+MoreEmotes
+LetMeLookDown
+Mimics

Updated mods:
MoreCompany  -> 1.7.0
HelmetCamera -> 2.1.3
LC_API? (Not sure if v0.3 used 2.1.0 or 2.1.1)

Config:
Changed default values for HelmetCamera
	monitorResolution  0 ->  3
	renderDistance	  20 -> 50
Looks better than default and should have minimal performance impact

Notes:
Added minor revision placeholder for when I have to remove a mod :^)
Added this file (modpack_changelog.txt)
Added modpack_versions.txt	-Versions for individual mods to track what needs updating
Added MODPACK_README.txt	-Installation and updating instructions
