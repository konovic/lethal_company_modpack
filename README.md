## Lethal Company Modpack
Personal modpack for Lethal Company.\
All rights held by the respective mod authors.

#### DOWNLOAD:
Navigate to the [latest release](https://github.com/konovic/lethal_company_modpack/releases/latest) for this repository and download `Source code (zip)`.

#### INSTALL:
This guide assumes you're using a fresh install of Lethal Company. If you have a previous set of mods installed, backup your BepInEx folder somewhere else and remove it from the `Lethal Company` folder.
1. Locate and open the Lethal Company installation folder (default: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Lethal Company`).
2. Unzip/open `lethal_company_modpack-*.zip`.
3. Move the contents of the `modpack` folder into the `Lethal Company` folder from step 1.
4. (Optional) Configure each mod by editing the config files in `BepInEx/config`.

#### UPDATE:
1. Locate and open the Lethal Company installation folder (default: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Lethal Company`).
2. Skip this step if you have not modified any files in `BepInEx\config`
1. Backup your `BepInEx\config` folder to a temporary safe location e.g. the desktop (failing to do so will revert all configs to their default values).
3. Skip this step if you have not modified any files in `BepInEx\plugins`
1. Backup any folders with manual modifications, for example `BepInEx\plugins\moresuits` if you added a `!less-suits.txt` file.
4. Delete the existing `BepInEx` folder and everything within it.
5. Follow the steps for `INSTALL` as above.
6. If you performed step 2, copy the `config` folder back into the `Lethal Company\BepInEx` folder.\
Note: I'll try to make a note in the `Releases` section if I notice that a mod config has new/updated values. In that case, you would want to manually edit the new config's updated values.
7. If you performed step 3, restore any additional files/folders. Take care when overwriting files from newer mod versions.
