1. Locate and open the Lethal Company installation folder (default: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Lethal Company)
2. Unzip/open lethal_company_mods_v*.zip
3. Move the contents of the lethal_company_mods folder (the contents, not the folder itself) into the Lethal Company installation folder opened in step 1

1.  Locate and open the Lethal Company installation folder (default: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Lethal Company)
2.  Copy/move your BepInEx\config folder somewhere safe e.g. the desktop (failing to do so will revert any changes made to the default configs)
3a. Skip this step if you haven't manually modified any files in BepInEx\plugins
3b.     Copy/move any folders with manual modifications, e.g. BepInEx\plugins\moresuits if you added a !less-suits.txt file
4.  Delete the existing BepInEx folder and everything within it
5.  Follow INSTALLING as above, overwrite all existing files
6.  Copy the BepInEx\config folder back into BepInEx, overwrite all existing files
7.  Restore any additional folders saved during step 3b, take care when overwriting files from newer mod versions
